# Capstone Project - Game Play and Student Performance

## Executive Summary

Learning can be fun. There are many educational platforms exploring the space of gamified learning. 

The gamified learning experience offers a powerful approach to education, leveraging the motivational aspects of games to enhance engagement, retention, and collaboration. By incorporating game elements into the learning process, educators can create immersive and interactive educational environments that foster a love for learning and empower learners to reach their full potential.

Good examples of successful gamified learning spaces are [PBS Wisconsin Education](https://pbswisconsineducation.org/) and [Education.com](https://www.education.com/games/).

This project is a version of the [Kaggle Competition: Predict Student Performance from Game Play](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/predict-student-performance-from-game-play/overview). It uses one of the largest publicly available game log data from the educational title: "Jo Wilder and the Capitol Case".

## Problem Statement

The aim is to develop a reliable model trained on game logs for a group of students, and predict their correctness in answering questions set at different milestones in the game. Based on the different outcomes, students will be recommended with suitable game content for further learning and practice. 

The work will help advance findings into knowledge-tracing methods for gamified learning and support developers of educational games to create more effective learning experiences for students.
