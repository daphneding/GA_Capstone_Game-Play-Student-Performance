# Capstone Project - Game Play and Student Performance

## Executive Summary

Learning can be fun. There are many educational platforms exploring the space of gamified learning. However, the general lack of tracking and supporting system makes it difficult for students to understand the gaps in learning and to achieve the optimal learning outcomes. 


### Problem Statement

This project is an enhanced version of the [Kaggle Competition: Predict Student Performance from Game Play](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/predict-student-performance-from-game-play/overview).

The aim is to develop a reliable model trained on game logs for a group of students, and predict their correctness in answering questions set at different milestones in the game. Based on the different levels of outcome, students will be recommended with suitable game content for further learning and practice. 

The work will help advance findings into knowledge-tracing methods for gamified learning and support developers of educational games to create more effective learning experiences for students.
