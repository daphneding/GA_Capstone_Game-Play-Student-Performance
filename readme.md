# Game Play and Student Performance

## Executive Summary

Learning can be fun. There are many educational platforms exploring the space of gamified learning. 

The gamified learning experience offers a powerful approach to education, leveraging the motivational aspects of games to enhance engagement, retention, and collaboration. By incorporating game elements into the learning process, educators can create immersive and interactive educational environments that foster a love for learning and empower learners to reach their full potential.

Good examples of successful gamified learning spaces are [PBS Wisconsin Education](https://pbswisconsineducation.org/) and [Education.com](https://www.education.com/games/).

This project analyses the largest publicly available game log data from educational title: "[Jo Wilder and the Capitol Case](https://pbswisconsineducation.org/jowilder/about/)", Ref:[Kaggle Competition: Predict Student Performance from Game Play](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/predict-student-performance-from-game-play/overview) and predicts the students' learning outcomes from game play.


## Problem Statement

Develop a reliable model trained on game logs for a group of students, and predict their correctness in answering questions (to assess their learning outcomes). 

The model will be helpful in improving the game design to optimise learning outcomes, as well as recommending suitable game content for studentsâ€™ further learning and practice.
